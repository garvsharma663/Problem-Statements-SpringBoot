## What is ResponseEntity?

ResponseEntity<T> is a Spring class that represents the entire HTTP response, including:

Status code (like 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 201 Created, etc.)

Headers (like Content-Type, Location, etc.)

Body (the actual data â€” like JSON or text)

In simple terms, it lets you fully control what goes back to the client.
